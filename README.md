### About

Created as an experiment to see just how far I could get with making a mud codebase from scratch.

I noticed that most Java Mud's had either one of two problems.
1. They were programmed to much like C/C++ servers.
2. They didn't actually work.

I seek to resolve this problem.

### Required Libraries
FxMud uses a few minor libraries. Mainly for tasks that would otherwise be complicated.

* [__Gson-2.2.4__](https://code.google.com/p/google-gson/) - But any recent version will work.

### About the Author

A long time I worked as a programmer on MUDs. I thought it was interesting.
These days I muds are probably about dead. But there has always been a part of me that
always wanted to design a MUD from scratch.

So I decided to make a clean, small, simple but Complete mud codebase that anyone who
has a love for Java can use.
